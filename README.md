A Blended up Vanilla and Tekkit style Modpack for reto style fun.

-Working Modcount=172

Influenced by Tekkit and Tekkit Classic, this is a collaboration of some of my favorite packs tech aspects, that is a throwback to where it all beganÂ  Vanilla, Tekkit and FTB of course!
Focus on simple or complex tech, tinker with some nuclear reactors, design architectural unique structures (had to have architectural craft in there), try some computer programming, or explore sapce/alternate dimensions.

The goal here is to capture the feel of the original packs while trying to make it fun, enjoyable for all players just to have a good time with some great ol' tekkit and FTB style mods.
