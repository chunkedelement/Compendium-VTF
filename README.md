A Blended up Vanilla and Tekkit style Modpack for reto style fun.

-Working Modcount=170

This is a collaboration of some of my favorite packs tech aspects from where it started for me and many others. This pack is a throwback to where it all began after Vanilla....Tekkit and FTB of course!  

The goal here is to capture the feel of the original packs while trying to make it fun, enjoyable for all players just to have a good time with some great ol' tekkit and FTB style mods.
